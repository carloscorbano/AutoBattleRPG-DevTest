> Kokku Software Engineer Applicant Test
> Current Version: 1.0.0
==============================

### TODO List: ###

> [ ] This application is an auto-battle RPG, that has a "grid" with cells/tiles/boxes organized as a matrix.
> [ ] This grid provides the length for the x and y-axis.
> [ ] There is also a Character with a Name, Health, BaseDamage, DamageMultiplier, current cell/box, target, and an Index.
> [ ] Each team should have one move per turn (except when the move places the character in attack range of an opposing team character)
> [ ] The game should work with a "battlefield" of any size, including a non-square matrix, for example 6x6 or 6x10 tiles in the grid.
> [ ] Make sure all the variables in CHARACTER are engaged in a code feature.
> [ ] The game should inform the player when the battle is over and which team has been declared victorious.
> [ ] The battlefield should only be reprinted/redrawn if a player makes a move.
> [ ] Each character should look for a possible target and attack it when this is viable and if not, move closer into attack range.
> [ ] Each candidate must also implement one of the following extra features in the application, to be selected depending on their month of birth.
> [ ] Characters cannot be on the same tile at the same time.
